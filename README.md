Let's make an app in Fuse in ~~20mins~~ 15mins :)

## Idea
The original app was to be made in 20mins live on stage during my talk at Web Unleashed:
http://fitc.ca/presentation/the-fuse-approach-to-mobile-app-development/

However, it took much less time in practice; more like 10-15mins.

Check out the [official fuse example projects](https://www.fusetools.com/examples) to see more of this stuff :)
